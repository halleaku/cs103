        <h3>Why I love to do this</h3>
        <p>Growing up in my grandparent's home was a big part of why I love photography. My grandpa had this old camera
            he loved, and one of his hobbies was developing photos. I used to watch him do it.
            <br>
            <br>
            What made it even more special was how much of his time was dedicated to documenting the life of his children,
            including my mom, my aunties, and my uncles. He captured their smiles, their growth, and their milestones.
            Growing up, I was fortunate to live in my grandparent's home, surrounded by these precious snapshots of my
            family's history.

            Each photo was like a portal into a different time and place, and I could trace them to specific locations
            in the house whether it was the garage, the living room and anywhere else. Every corner in that house had
            its own stories, and for me, it was also surreal to see just how much things had changed now that my
            grandpa's home was housing the next generation; me and my sister</p>
